# rubik's qube

this is one of my favorite projects so far. i had to use just about everything i know, including:

- data structures (graph)
- recursion
- 2d array manipulation (so so much of this)
- inheritance
- parsing methods

and most importantly... **dijikstra's algorithm!!!**

the main idea is that there is a rubik's cube, you can scramble it with the "scramble()" method, and then solve it with the same class.  it will also print out the instrucutions.   i'm thinking of adding a feature where you can type the rubik's cube faces into the command line, and it will tell you how to solve the cube, as opposed to only solving the cube stored as a static variable.
